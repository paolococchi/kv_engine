/**
 * The BackfillManager is responsible for multiple DCP backfill
 * operations owned by a single DCP connection.
 * It consists of two main classes:
 *
 * - BackfillManager, which acts as the main interface for adding new
 *    streams.
 * - BackfillManagerTask, which runs on a background AUXIO thread and
 *    performs most of the actual backfilling operations.
 *
 * One main purpose of the BackfillManager is to impose a limit on the
 * in-memory buffer space a streams' backfills consume - often
 * ep-engine can read data from disk faster than the client connection
 * can consume it, and so without any limits we could exhaust the
 * bucket quota and cause Items to be evicted from the HashTable,
 * which is Bad. At a high level, these limits are based on giving
 * each DCP connection a maximum amount of buffer space, and pausing
 * backfills if the buffer limit is reached. When the buffers are
 * sufficiently drained (by sending to the client), backfilling can be
 * resumed.
 *
 * Significant configuration parameters affecting backfill:
 * - dcp_scan_byte_limit
 * - dcp_scan_item_limit
 * - dcp_backfill_byte_limit
